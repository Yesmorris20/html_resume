    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Mexican architect based in Panam√° City, Panama. Currently, I am pursuing a 
        Master's degree in Construction Project Management at the Technological University of Panama.
        I've always been fascinated with project management and enjoy deconstructing complex problems 
        to create tangible projects that address real-world needs. In my free time, I like to stay 
        up-to-date with the latest technology trends, and I take pleasure in learning new things.
